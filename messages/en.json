    "title": "About me",
    "description1": "While pursuing dual degrees in Marketing and International Business Studies at California State University Long Beach, I delved into a world of real-world experiences that shaped my current outlook. It's these adventures that truly built my foundations, adding depth to both my work and life outside the code editor. Even back then, I had an inkling that mixing coding with a splash of adventure and creativity would be my sweet spot.",
    "description2": "Fast forward to today—I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer thriving in NYC. Coding's my forte; JavaScript, React, and Node keep my days buzzing with problem solving and innovation. But life's more than just code. I'm all about nurturing connections and growth, whether it's mentoring junior developers or crafting experiences that blend art, music, and genuine human interaction. And when I'm not coding, I'm plunging into the depths of the ocean, exploring reefs, or soaking up the sun on a beach in Australia. With experiences in 60 countries and a year living the nomad life, each adventure continues to fuel my passion for tech and creativity."
