    "title": "About",
    "description1": "While pursuing dual degrees in Marketing and International Business Studies at California State University Long Beach, I delved into a world of real-world experiences that shaped my current outlook. These adventures truly built my foundations, adding depth to both my work and life outside the code editor. Even back then, I had an inkling that mixing coding with a splash of adventure and creativity would be my sweet spot.",
    "description2": "Fast forward to today—I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer II at Rotaready, where I've led critical feature development, migrated our entire front-end codebase to TypeScript, and contributed to 165% ARR growth post-acquisition. Beyond engineering, I've contributed to project management, design, client support, and marketing, demonstrating versatility in startup environments. I'm also currently serving as Board President for a cooperative housing corporation, leading community initiatives and governance. When I'm not coding, I'm plunging into the depths of the ocean exploring reefs, or mentoring developers through programs like Meet a Mentor (MaM). With experiences in 60+ countries and a year living the nomad life, each adventure continues to fuel my passion for tech and creativity."
