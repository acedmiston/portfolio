        While pursuing dual degrees in Marketing and International Business
        Studies at California State University Long Beach, I delved into a world
        of real-world experiences that shaped my current outlook. It&apos;s
        these adventures that truly built my foundations, adding depth to both
        my work and life outside the code editor. Even back then, I had an
        inkling that mixing coding with a splash of adventure and creativity
        would be my sweet spot.

        Fast forward to todayâ€”I&apos;m a Full-Stack Software Engineer thriving
        in NYC. Coding&apos;s my forte; JavaScript, React, and Node keep my days
        buzzing with problem solving and innovation. But life&apos;s more than
        just code. I&apos;m all about nurturing connections and growth, whether
        it&apos;s mentoring junior developers or crafting experiences that blend
        art, music, and genuine human interaction. And when I&apos;m not coding,
        I&apos;m plunging into the depths of the ocean, exploring reefs, or
        soaking up the sun on a beach in Australia. With experiences in 60
        countries and a year living the nomad life, each adventure continues to
        fuel my passion for tech and creativity.
